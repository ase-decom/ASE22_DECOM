construct a string representing a byte array . use run - length encoding . two bytes are packed into a single char , with a single extra zero byte at the end if needed . a byte represents itself , unless it is the escape_byte . then the following notations are possible : escape_byte escape_byte escape_byte literal escape_byte n b n instances of byte b since an encoded run occupies 3 bytes , we only encode runs of 4 or more bytes . thus we have n > 0 and n ! = escape_byte and n < = 0xff . if we encounter a run where n = = escape_byte , we represent this as : b escape_byte n - 1 b the escape_byte value is chosen so as not to collide with commonly seen values .

note that the acknowledge method of message acknowledges all messages received on that messages session . message . acknowledge ( ) method : clarify that the method applies to all consumed messages of the session . rationale for this change : a possible misinterpretation of the existing java api documentation for message . acknowledge assumed that only messages received prior to ? this ? message should be acknowledged . the updated java api documentation statement emphasizes that message acknowledgment is really a session - level activity and that this message is only being used to identify the session in order to acknowledge all messages consumed by the session . the acknowledge method was placed in the message object only to enable easy access to acknowledgment capability within a message listener ? s onmessage method . this change aligns the specification and java api documentation to define message . acknowledge in the same manner . method acknowledging the received messages . we iterate over all the destination names ( the m_deliveries hash ) and then on each messageacks vec we perform the actual write of jmsackdataentry to the space , using the info inside each ack obj . the ack obj , is an inner class wrapper that holds all the required information for a successful acknowledge .

this method sends out n ( for small n ) multicast requests . until the last request is sent out , this method sleeps for 5 seconds after each request is sent . after the last request is sent , this method sleeps for 2 minutes to allow the responselistener time to receive and process any multicast responses sent in reply to the multicast requests . before sending a request , a new multicast request is constructed so that updates can be made to the set of service ids of the lookup services discovered due to previous requests . < p > after all requests have been sent , and the responselistener has been given the appropriate time to receive and process any multicast responses , if there are no more active instances of this thread , this method terminates ( interrupts ) the responselistener . note that although it is more desirable to have the responselistener set a timeout on the server socket ( using setsotimeout ) and then simply exit after a period of time in which both the responselistener has been idle , and there have been no active requestor threads , using setsotimeout in this way can cause random hangs on the solaris ( tm ) operating system .

dom level 1 did not have a standard mechanism for creating a new document object . this function provides a dom - implementation - independent abstraction for that for that concept . it ' s typically used when outputting a new dom as the result of an operation . < p > todo : this is n ' t directly compatable with dom level 2 . the level 2 createdocument call also creates the root element , and thus requires that you know what that element will be before creating the document . we should think about whether we want to change this code , and the callers , so we can use the dom ' s own method . ( it ' s also possible that dom level 3 may relax this sequence , but you may give up some intelligence in the dom by doing so ; the intent was that knowing the document type and root element might let the dom automatically switch to a specialized subclass for particular kinds of documents . )

pseudocode : for each for in destination image check that all dependent rows in source image is scaled horizontally and stored in work pixels if not then scale missing rows horizontal and store them in work pixels scale the destination row vertically and store the result in out pixels it may seem counter intuitive that the vertical scale is done for each row . the simple scaling algorithm would first scale the image horizontal ( a row at a time ) into the temp image , and then scale the temp image vertically ( a column at a time ) into the final image . the disadvantage of the simple approach is that you need a large temporary image . i have avoided this by doing the vertically scale a row at a time . scaling a single row vertically , needs the horizontally scaled rows that the scaling depends on . these dependencies will be lazy initialized . since we know the height of the ' window ' we work on ( the maximum number of source rows needed to calculate a dest row ) , the work pixels only needs to have the same height . instead of creating a temporary image with a height different from the source image ' s height , i created a double array where inner array is repeated ( so if the window height is 3 the first and the forth row is the same instance ) . this keeps algorithm a bit simpler ( the alternative would be to maintain a mapping between )

main worker run loop . repeatedly gets tasks from queue and executes them , while coping with a number of issues : 1 . we may start out with an initial task , in which case we do n ' t need to get the first one . otherwise , as long as pool is running , we get tasks from gettask . if it returns null then the worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration parameters . other exits result from exception throws in external code , in which case completedabruptly holds , which usually leads processworkerexit to replace this thread . 2 . before running any task , the lock is acquired to prevent other pool interrupts while the task is executing , and then we ensure that unless pool is stopping , this thread does not have its interrupt set . 3 . each task run is preceded by a call to beforeexecute , which might throw an exception , in which case we cause thread to die ( breaking loop with completedabruptly true ) without processing the task . 4 . assuming beforeexecute completes normally , we run the task , gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterexecute . we separately handle runtimeexception , error ( both of which the specs guarantee that we trap ) and arbitrary throwables . because we can not rethrow throwables within runnable . run , we wrap them within errors on the way out ( to the thread ' s uncaughtexceptionhandler ) . any thrown exception also conservatively causes thread to die . 5 . after task . run completes , we call afterexecute , which may also throw an exception , which will also cause thread to die . according to jls sec 14 . 20 , this exception is the one that will be in effect even if task . run throws . the net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterexecute and the thread ' s uncaughtexceptionhandler have as accurate information as we can provide about any problems encountered by user code .

this method deals with the fact , that the decoding process does n ' t always yield a single most likely value . the current error correction implementation does n ' t deal with erasures very well , so it ' s better to provide a value for these ambiguous codewords instead of treating it as an erasure . the problem is that we do n ' t know which of the ambiguous values to choose . we try decode using the first value , and if that fails , we use another of the ambiguous values and try to decode again . this usually only happens on very hard to read and decode barcodes , so decoding the normal barcodes is not affected by this .

returns node holding key or null if no such , clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way . repeatedly traverses at base - level looking for key starting at predecessor returned from findpredecessor , processing base - level deletions as encountered . some callers rely on this side - effect of clearing deleted nodes . restarts occur , at traversal step centered on node n , if : ( 1 ) after reading n ' s next field , n is no longer assumed predecessor b ' s current successor , which means that we do n ' t have a consistent 3 - node snapshot and so can not unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered . ( 2 ) n ' s value field is null , indicating n is deleted , in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying . even though there are cases where such unlinking does n ' t require restart , they are n ' t sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting . ( 3 ) n is a marker or n ' s predecessor ' s value field is null , indicating ( among other possibilities ) that findpredecessor returned a deleted node . we ca n ' t unlink the node because we do n ' t know its predecessor , so rely on another call to findpredecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor , which it will do . this check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop , ( and the b . value check is n ' t strictly needed at all ) but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links , and so will retry anyway . the traversal loops in doput , doremove , and findnear all include the same three kinds of checks . and specialized versions appear in findfirst , and findlast and their variants . they ca n ' t easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed .
