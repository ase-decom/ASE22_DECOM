calculates whether we need to reevluate the key for the region entry we added a way to determine whether to reevaluate an entry for query execution the method is to keep track of the delta and current time in a single long value the value is then used by the query to determine if a region entry needs to be reevaluated , based on subtracting the value with the query execution time . this provides a delta + some false positive time ( dts ) if the dts + last modified time of the region entry is > query start time , we can assume that it needs to be reevaluated this is to fix bug 47475 , where references to region entries can be held by the executing query either directly or indirectly ( iterators can hold references for next ) but the values underneath could change . small amounts of false positives are ok as it will have a slight impact on performance

todo in order to support cbd , we will also have to recognize statements that describe blank nodes that are part of the description of a described resource as belonging to that described resource . this is necessary in order to capture the transitive closure of the resource description specified by cbd . the code in this method only recognizes statements that directly have a described resource as a subject or object . we probably need a reverse map that will allow us to navigate from a bigdatavalue ( or perhaps just a bigdatabnode ) to all described resources for which that value was observed . that map might only need to contain the blank nodes since the description can never expand beyond a statement having a blank node in the subject ( or object ) position and a non - blank node in the object ( or subject ) position .

build mapping tables based on the line count of the given source string . these tables allow us to compute starting and ending locations of each line of the source file . the assumption using this technique is that most lines of the source files will never be accessed thus we only incur the overhead of 8 bytes ( start & end ) per line , plus the actual string contents each line a line is requested . thus we need 8 * num_files * num_lines_per_file bytes for all these maps . for example , say each file is 1000 lines and we have 400 source files ; we would consume 3 . 2mb . with each request we would allocate an additional 20 + bytes for the string ( assuming a 20b avg line length ) . allocating each line individually we would consume 1000 * 400 * 20 = 8mb . it is debatable whether this scheme is more efficient than actually builing an array of strings to contain the lines , but gut feel says it is ; )

causes current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the method or the method for this object , or a specified amount of time has elapsed . the current thread must own this object ' s monitor . this method causes the current thread ( call it t ) to place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish any and all synchronization claims on this object . thread t becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four things happens : some other thread invokes the notify method for this object and thread t happens to be arbitrarily chosen as the thread to be awakened . some other thread invokes the notifyall method for this object . some other thread interrupts thread t . the specified amount of real time has elapsed , more or less . if timeout is zero , however , then real time is not taken into consideration and the thread simply waits until notified . the thread t is then removed from the wait set for this object and re - enabled for thread scheduling . it then competes in the usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the object ; once it has gained control of the object , all its synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo ante - that is , to the situation as of the time that the wait method was invoked . thread t then returns from the invocation of the wait method . thus , on return from the wait method , the synchronization state of the object and of thread t is exactly as it was when the wait method was invoked . if the current thread is interrupted by another thread while it is waiting , then an interruptedexception is thrown . this exception is not thrown until the lock status of this object has been restored as described above . note that the wait method , as it places the current thread into the wait set for this object , unlocks only this object ; any other objects on which the current thread may be synchronized remain locked while the thread waits . this method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object ' s monitor . see the notify method for a description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of a monitor .

creates a string representation of the double argument . all characters mentioned below are ascii characters . if the argument is nan , the result is the string " nan " . otherwise , the result is a string that represents the sign and magnitude ( absolute value ) of the argument . if the sign is negative , the first character of the result is ' - ' ( ' - ' ) ; if the sign is positive , no sign character appears in the result . as for the magnitude : if is infinity , it is represented by the characters " infinity " ; thus , positive infinity produces the result " infinity " and negative infinity produces the result " - infinity " . if is zero , it is represented by the characters " 0 . 0 " ; thus , negative zero produces the result " - 0 . 0 " and positive zero produces the result " 0 . 0 " . if is greater than or equal to 10 - 3 but less than 107 , then it is represented as the integer part of , in decimal form with no leading zeroes , followed by ' . ' ( . ) , followed by one or more decimal digits representing the fractional part of . if is less than 10 - 3 or not less than 107 , then it is represented in so - called " computerized scientific notation . " let be the unique integer such that 10n = 10n + 1 ; then let be the mathematically exact quotient of and 10n so that 1 = 10 . the magnitude is then represented as the integer part of , as a single decimal digit , followed by ' . ' ( . ) , followed by decimal digits representing the fractional part of , followed by the letter ' e ' ( e ) , followed by a representation of as a decimal integer , as produced by the method . how many digits must be printed for the fractional part of m or a ? there must be at least one digit to represent the fractional part , and beyond that as many , but only as many , more digits as are needed to uniquely distinguish the argument value from adjacent values of type double . that is , suppose that x is the exact mathematical value represented by the decimal representation produced by this method for a finite nonzero argument d . then d must be the double value nearest to x ; or if two double values are equally close to x , then d must be one of them and the least significant bit of the significand of d must be 0 .

parses elements with the given parser .
gets the gap between this interval and another interval . the other interval can be either before or after this interval . < p > intervals are inclusive of the start instant and exclusive of the end . an interval has a gap to another interval if there is a non - zero duration between them . this method returns the amount of the gap only if the intervals do actually have a gap between them . if the intervals overlap or abut , then null is returned . < p > when two intervals are compared the result is one of three states : ( a ) they abut , ( b ) there is a gap between them , ( c ) they overlap . the abuts state takes precedence over the other two , thus a zero duration interval at the start of a larger interval abuts and does not overlap . < p > the chronology of the returned interval is the same as that of this interval ( the chronology of the interval parameter is not used ) . note that the use of the chronology was only correctly implemented in version 1 . 3 .

encode char array to utf - 8 byte array , with sql escape . driver exchange with server use exclusively utf - 8 and lot of parameters are string . most the time spend using driver is spend transforming string parameters in utf - 8 escaped bytes . every string as to be escaped to avoid sql injection , so whe must loop through the string char array to add escape chars , creating a new char array , and after decoding this char array to utf - 8 bytes . using standard java , this result in : - recreating a lot of char array ( and copy to new array ) during escape . - utf - 8 encoding is using internally a byte array initialized to 3 * the char length and will be spliced when final length is known . when dealing with big string , that is using a lot of array for nothing ( and so memory issues ) resulting byte array will be send to outputstream , so : - escape characters are ascii characters ( one byte ) - > the escaped characters can be put directly in array - driver do n ' t need the final byte array shrink , the byte array can be send directly in outputstream . example for a 1k character string : if using standard java - getting tochararray ( ) will create a new 1k char array ( and copy existing array into it ) . - escaping ( using a stringbuffer ) will use a new 1k char array and the internal array may expand ( = > new allocation + copy ) if there is any char to be escape - getbytes ( " utf - 8 " ) : a new 3k byte buffer will be created , and finally a new one ( + copy into it ) when real length is known . current implementation : - creating a 3k bytes array , send directly these array with length into outputstream . = > only one array .

the real work of making the state table deterministic happens here . this function merges a state in the state table ( specified by rownum ) with a state that is passed in ( newvalues ) . the basic process is to copy the nonzero cells in newstates into the state in the state table ( we ' ll call that oldvalues ) . if there ' s a collision ( i . e . , if the same cell has a nonzero value in both states , and it ' s not the same value ) , then we have to reconcile the collision . we do this by creating a new state , adding it to the end of the state table , and using this function recursively to merge the original two states into a single , combined state . this process may happen recursively ( i . e . , each successive level may involve collisions ) . to prevent infinite recursion , we keep a log of merge operations . any time we ' re merging two states we ' ve merged before , we can just supply the row number for the result of that merge operation rather than creating a new state just like it .

to support deletion we will remove any entries for the provided address . this is just to yank something out of the cache which was created and then immediately deleted on the rw store before it could be written through to the disk . this does not reclaim any space in the write cache since allocations are strictly sequential within the cache and can only be used with the rw store . the rw store uses write prefixes in the cache buffer so we must zero the long address element as well to indicate that the record was removed from the buffer . this approach has now been refined to avoid problems with incremental checksums which otherwise would invalidate the buffer checksum to date . rather than zeroing the address of the deleted block a new zero - length prefix is written that when processed will ensure any current recordmap entry is removed . todo : an issue to be worked through is whether there remains a problem with a full buffer where there is not room for the dummy " remove " prefix . whilst we could of course ensure that a buffer with less than the space required for prefixwrites should be moved immediately to the dirtlylist , there would still exist the possibility that the clear could be requested on a buffer already on the dirtylist . it looks like this should not matter , since each buffer update can be considered as an atomic update even if the set of writes are individually not atomic ( the updates from a previous buffer will always have been completed before the next buffer is processed ) . in that case it appears we could ignore the situation where there is no room for the dummy " remove " prefix , since there will be no room for a new write also and the buffer will be flushed either on commit or a subsequent write . a problem previously existed with unsynchronized access to the bytebuffer . resulting in a conflict over the position ( ) and buffer corruption . if the writecache is closed then it must not be modified at all otherwise any ha replication will not be binary compatible .
